                <p> A traveling sketchbook is a collaborative art journal/sketchbook passed back and forth between two people. Each person makes a piece in the book in whatever medium or artstyle they want during their time before sending it off to the next person. The idea behind it is that by working on this with another person keeps you motivated to create by sharing this passion with your friend, and also keeps you accountable to create, by giving you a deadline and a person to oversee that you’ve completed your pages. It is meant to be a fun activity that encourages you to experiment and grow as an artist. </p>

                <h2>Origins</h2>
                <p class="end-page">I struggled with motivation for practicing art and being able to start pieces. I was inspired by those videos of people showing off their overflowing sketchbooks and the concept behind the movie  “The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants”. From this I came up with the idea of a sketchbook or art journal that would be passed between a friend and myself to keep me motivated and having fun with creating. I proposed the idea to my friend and she also thought it would be a fun idea to try out. So, on July 24, 2021 we picked out a sketchbook from Michaels and started on our journey of creativity and accountability. We started with a title page documenting our starting date and the first week was mine to complete. We worked on a weekly schedule where we each had the book for a week before dropping it off to the other person. We started our traveling sketchbook during the summer after our grade 11 year and maintained it consistently throughout our grade 12 year and over the summer for a total of 14 months of work into it. This came to a close when I moved 2 hours away to start university that fall. The sketchbook allowed me to stay motivated and gave me a reason to create every other week, and gave me a sense of accountability to creating. It gave me a space to experiment with different styles and inspirations and to push myself out of my comfort zone with my art. Overall it was a valuable and positive experience that was not only great practice but also lots of fun.</p>
