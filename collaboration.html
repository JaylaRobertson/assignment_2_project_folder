                    <h2>Why do this collaboratively?</h2>
                    <p>Having another person to do this with gives you both accountability. Having another person working on the same project as you and getting excited about it as well feeds into a cycle of caring and staying motivated. It also creates a deadline which serves to help you be forced to create instead of putting it off. Creating can be daunting and putting things off for when you have more time, or you feel you would be better equipped to do your ideas are easy to get lost in; a collaborative book gives you a reason to push through those thoughts. What is nice about doing this between friends is that occasionally missing a week isn’t the end of the world and there is no stress of consequences as there is in a school or workplace environment; it is safe to take a break and catch up later.</p>

                    <h2>Choosing a partner</h2>
                    <p>Choosing a friend who has similar goals to you will help keep you both invested. There is no limit to how many people you can involve in this project, it is up to you to balance the time each person has with the book and how many people are involved. If you want you can have a few main people creating on a regular basis and some guests who come in occasionally to do a page. There are no hard fast rules, bend the medium so that it works best for what you want out of it. </p>
                    <h2>Sharing the book</h2>
                    <p class="end-page">Discuss with your partner(s) as to how long each person will have the book at a time and what predetermined number of pages you’ll each get done in that time. Every other week is what I would recommend, but more or less than that will work too. The timeline will affect how many finished spreads will get done in a period of time, the longer the time period for each piece the longer it will take to fill the same number of pages.</p>

                    <h2 class="top-page">Formatting Pages</h2>
                    <p>Consider what you want to incorporate into each person's spread, such as the date and name of the creator. Consider how many pages to do per person's time with the book.</p>

                            <p>Using only one page out of a hardbound sketchbook, or one side of a spiral bound sketchbook. Less space to work with. </p>

                            <p>Having each person’s artwork on either side of the same pages</p>
                            <p>Benefits:</p>
                            <p>Gives book really immersive and full feeling </p>

                            <p>Can't separate pages.</p>
                            <p>If signing and dating it will need to go somewhere on the piece.</p>
                            <p>Runs risk of bleeding through pages onto other person’s artwork.</p>

                                <p>Benefits:</p>
                                <p>Won't leak materials (ink, glue, paint, ect.) to the other side of the page.</p>
                                <p>Can put the date and signature on the opposite side of the page.</p>
                                <p>Easy to separate individuals works.</p>
                                <p>Cons:</p>
                                <p>More spaces to fill in specified time limit.</p>

                    <h2>Who Keeps it?</h2>
                    <p class="end-page end-end-page">Discussing this with your partner ahead of time what will happen with the final finished product may guide how you go about the formatting of your traveling sketchbook. One option is to decide upon one person keeping it, or decide on a shared custody where it travels back and forth even after its completion. Another possibility is to dismantle the finished book and separate each member's works. These can then either be displayed as is or rebound into two separate books.  It is worth it to decide this early on in order to avoid potential conflict down the road.</p>
